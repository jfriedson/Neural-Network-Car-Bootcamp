# Car AI - Neural Network Trained by a Genetic Algorithm
This demo is meant to demonstrate the process of a neural network driven car being bread and mutated by a genetical algorithn to navigate a track quickly using 7 forward-facing depth sensors and a speedometer as input and having full operation of a 45 degree steering angle, gas throttle, standard break pressure, and e-break pressure.  The neural network used contains 1 hidden layer of 15 neurons, and the simulation is sped up x15 to make a quick learning demo.
